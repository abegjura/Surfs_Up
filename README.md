Module 9

##Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide our clint, W Avy, analysis into the weather patterns in Oahu, Hawaii. W Avy is interested in opening up another surf shop and wants to analyze the data to see if it the analysis predicts cetian shortfalls

##Results
•	Many of the statistics are close between June and December
•	The avg temp in June is 75 and Dec 71 degrees
•	The max temp in June is 85 and Dec 83 degrees
•	The minimum temp in June is 64 and Dec 56 degrees

##Summary
The data clearly shows a surf shop in Oahu will do great business for most of the year, except for December where the temps drop to 56 degrees. W Avy may think of reducing staff work time and open hours during December to reduce overhead and cost during the slow time. The data clearly shows when W Avy’s concerns would kick in, but it seems a profitable business 10 to 11 months out of the year.
